# web_scrapper
This is a python project to scrape web data using selenium<br>
Selenium is a open source automated testing tool for web based applications. In this project, I have scraped some texts from the website of the Central Bank of Bangladesh:<br>

To use selenium in python, install below two packages by running in linux terminal:<br>
pip3 install selenium<br>
pip3 install webdriver-manager<br>

Then execute the code.
